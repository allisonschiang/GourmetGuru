## Overview
### Description
You type in what ingredients you have and the app will tell you recipes that you can make. You should also be able to add your own recipes for future reference.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Food and Drink
- **Mobile:** It involves REAL-TIME usage when someone is in the kitchen or going grocery shopping, which most people don't have their laptops during
- **Story:** A lot of people struggle with making new, exciting food, so we wanted to make an app to help people be inspired to make new foods.
- **Market:** The market is cooks and people wanting to cook more or digitally store their recipes. The market is pretty big because everyone needs to eat, and a lot of people want to improve their cooking.
- **Habit:** People use the app whenever they want to cook, which could be every couple of days, or even daily.
- **Scope:** This app isn't too challenging, as we learned many parts of how to make it already. We haven't used the chatgpt API yet, which would be the most challenged part
